# Bundling step by step instructions
This set of instructions will guide you through setting up bundling in an Aurelia application where Kendo is used. Since there are multiple skeleton-navigation flavors out there, this tutorial will use the [skeleton-esnext](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-esnext) flavor. So if you want to follow this tutorial, download skeleton-esnext and follow [these instructions](https://aurelia-ui-toolkits.gitbooks.io/kendoui-sdk-installation/content/jspm_based-installation/kendoui_pro/using_%60vendors%60_folder.html) to install Kendo and the aurelia-kendoui-bridge into the application.
