# Aurelia KendoUI Bridge Documentation

<br>
This document organized as a [Gitbook](gitbook.com) book contains all existing information about Aurelia KendoUI bridge plugin. Throughout this document we will use the term **Aurelia KendoUI Bridge** to denote the [Aurelia plugin](http://blog.durandal.io/2015/11/17/aurelia-beta-week-day-2-plugins/), and the term [Aurelia KendoUI catalog application](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#/samples/generic)to refer to the web application that presents the catalog of all Aurelia KendoUI components.

To simplify even further: 

- use the catalog app to find out the list of all Aurelia KendoUI components that you can use in your own Aurelia application.
- use the bridge plugin to provide access to Aurelia KendoUI access to your application. This means that the Aurelia KendoUI bridge is just one of many Javascript libraries organized as Aurelia plugins.
